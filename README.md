A circuit calculator and random circuit problem generator.

Born out of a desire to have a Flash-card style means of improving and exercising my Electrical Circuit formula knowledge I created this app to calculate all the varlues of a circuit and to be able to generate random circuits and prompt for the missing values so the user can test their knowledge.

Sure. There may be many like this, but this one is mine. I get to learn Typescript and EE along the way.
